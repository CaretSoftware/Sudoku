## About the Project

The Command Pattern allows for easy Undo-functionality.  
Recursion made the Sudoku generation code easier to write.  
Multithreading makes the loading asynchronous to allow for a better  
user experience as the game doesn't freeze up while the generation is happening.  
Utilising array math made the code much more compact and, in my opinion, much more readable.  

Use this repository to learn about recursion, the command pattern, or the basics of multithreading.
